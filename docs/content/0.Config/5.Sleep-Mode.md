# Sleep Mode

WiCAN can be **permanently attached to the car without worrying about draining the battery**. It monitors the battery voltage and can detect when the alternator is ON. When the engine is ON the battery continuously charging and the voltage will be about 13.5V (can vary with different car models). When the engine is OFF the battery voltage drops to about 12.8V(full battery) -  WiCAN can detect this drop, and if the voltage remains under the threshold for **3 min** it will go to sleep and the current consumption will drop below **1mA**. If the engine is turned ON it will immediately wake up and enable the WiFi/BLE.

The sleep mode can be configured on the "Settings" tab. By default it is disabled and default sleep voltage is 13.1.

## Battery Alert:

This is an important feature for most car enthusiast who own multiple cars that are only driven few times a year.  Basically if a car is not used in few month the battery will go flat and needs to be jumped. WiCAN can be configured to send an alert when the battery voltage drops under a certain level.

If **Sleep mode** and **Battery alert** both are enabled in the "Sleep Mode" section on the settings tab, the battery alert settings can be configured:

**For now alerts can be sent on MQTT, more protocols are coming soon. If there is a specific protocol you want to be supported let me know.**
